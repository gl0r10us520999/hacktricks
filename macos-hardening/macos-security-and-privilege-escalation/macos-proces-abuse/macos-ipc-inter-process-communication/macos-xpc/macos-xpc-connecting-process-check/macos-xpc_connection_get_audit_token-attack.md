**For further information check the original post: [https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing/](https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing/)**. This is a summary:


## Mach Messages Basic Info

If you don't know what Mach Messages are start checking this page:

{% content-ref url="../../../../mac-os-architecture/macos-ipc-inter-process-communication/" %}
[macos-ipc-inter-process-communication](../../../../mac-os-architecture/macos-ipc-inter-process-communication/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For the moment remember that ([definition from here](https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing)):\
Mach messages are sent over a _mach port_, which is a **single receiver, multiple sender communication** channel built into the mach kernel. **Multiple processes can send messages** to a mach port, but at any point **only a single process can read from it**. Just like file descriptors and sockets, mach ports are allocated and managed by the kernel and processes only see an integer, which they can use to indicate to the kernel which of their mach ports they want to use.

## XPC Connection

If you don't know how a XPC connection is established check:

## Vuln Summary

What is interesting for you to know is that **XPC‚Äôs abstraction is a one-to-one connection**, but it is based on top of a technology which **can have multiple senders, so:**

* Mach ports are single receiver, **multiple sender**.
* An XPC connection‚Äôs audit token is the audit token of **copied from the most recently received message**.
* Obtaining the **audit token** of an XPC connection is critical to many **security checks**.

Although the previous situation sounds promising there are some scenarios where this is not going to cause problems ([from here](https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing)):

* Audit tokens are often used for an authorization check to decide whether to accept a connection. As this happens using a message to the service port, there is **no connection established yet**. More messages on this port will just be handled as additional connection requests. So any **checks before accepting a connection are not vulnerable** (this also means that within `-listener:shouldAcceptNewConnection:` the audit token is safe). We are therefore **looking for XPC connections that verify specific actions**.
* XPC event handlers are handled synchronously. This means that the event handler for one message must be completed before calling it for the next one, even on concurrent dispatch queues. So inside an **XPC event handler the audit token can not be overwritten** by other normal (non-reply!) messages.

Two different methods this might be exploitable:

1. Variant1:
* **Exploit** **connects** to service **A** and service **B**
* Service **B** can call a **privileged functionality** in service A that the user cannot
* Service **A** calls **`xpc_connection_get_audit_token`** while _**not**_ inside the **event handler** for a connection in a **`dispatch_async`**.
* So a **different** message could **overwrite the Audit Token** because it's being dispatched asynchronously outside of the event handler.
* The exploit passes to **service B the SEND right to service A**.
* So svc **B** will be actually **sending** the **messages** to service **A**.
* The **exploit** tries to **call** the **privileged action.** In a RC svc **A** **checks** the authorization of this **action** while **svc B overwrote the Audit token** (giving the exploit access to call the privileged action).
2. Variant 2:
* Service **B** can call a **privileged functionality** in service A that the user cannot
* Exploit connects with **service A** which **sends** the exploit a **message expecting a response** in a specific **replay** **port**.
* Exploit sends **service** B a message passing **that reply port**.
* When service **B replies**, it s**ends the message to service A**, **while** the **exploit** sends a different **message to service A** trying to **reach a privileged functionality** and expecting that the reply from service B will overwrite the Audit token in the perfect moment (Race Condition).

## Variant 1: calling xpc\_connection\_get\_audit\_token outside of an event handler <a href="#variant-1-calling-xpc_connection_get_audit_token-outside-of-an-event-handler" id="variant-1-calling-xpc_connection_get_audit_token-outside-of-an-event-handler"></a>

Scenario:

* Two mach services **`A`** and **`B`** that we can both connect to (based on the sandbox profile and the authorization checks before accepting the connection).
* _**A**_ must have an **authorization check** for a specific action that **`B`** can pass (but our app can‚Äôt).
* For example, if B has some **entitlements** or is running as **root**, it might allow him to ask A to perform a privileged action.
* For this authorization check, **`A`** obtains the audit token asynchronously, for example by calling `xpc_connection_get_audit_token` from **`dispatch_async`**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In this case an attacker could trigger a **Race Condition** making a **exploit** that **asks A to perform an action** several times while making **B send messages to `A`**. When the RC is **successful**, the **audit token** of **B** will be copied in memory **while** the request of our **exploit** is being **handled** by A, giving it **access to the privilege action only B could request**.
{% endhint %}

This happened with **`A`** as `smd` and **`B`** as `diagnosticd`. The function [`SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless?language=objc) from smb an be used to install a new privileged helper toot (as **root**). If a **process running as root contact** **smd**, no other checks will be performed.

Therefore, the service **B** is **`diagnosticd`** because it runs as **root** and can be used to **monitor** a process, so once monitoring has started, it will **send multiple messages per second.**

To perform the attack:

1. Initiate a **connection** to the service named `smd` using the standard XPC protocol.
2. Form a secondary **connection** to `diagnosticd`. Contrary to normal procedure, rather than creating and sending two new mach ports, the client port send right is substituted with a duplicate of the **send right** associated with the `smd` connection.
3. As a result, XPC messages can be dispatched to `diagnosticd`, but responses from `diagnosticd` are rerouted to `smd`. To `smd`, it appears as though the messages from both the user and `diagnosticd` are originating from the same connection.
