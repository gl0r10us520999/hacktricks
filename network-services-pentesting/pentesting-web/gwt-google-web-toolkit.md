# GWT - Google Web Toolkit

---

## Introduction

Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is an open-source web framework developed by Google for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. It allows developers to write client-side Java code and then compile it into highly optimized JavaScript that runs across all browsers.

## Pentesting GWT Applications

### Information Gathering

When pentesting GWT applications, start by identifying the GWT-RPC endpoints. Look for URLs ending with `*.rpc` or `*.svc` as they are common patterns for GWT-RPC services.

### Exploiting GWT-RPC Endpoints

GWT-RPC endpoints can be vulnerable to various attacks such as Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Make sure to thoroughly test these endpoints for security vulnerabilities.

### Reverse Engineering GWT Applications

To reverse engineer a GWT application, decompile the compiled JavaScript code back to Java source code using tools like `jadx` or `jd-gui`. This can help in understanding the application's logic and finding potential security flaws.

### Client-Side Attacks

Since GWT applications heavily rely on client-side JavaScript, they are susceptible to client-side attacks like DOM manipulation, JavaScript injection, and sensitive data exposure. Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent such attacks.

### Conclusion

Pentesting GWT applications requires a good understanding of both Java and JavaScript, as well as knowledge of common web application vulnerabilities. By following a systematic approach and leveraging appropriate tools, security professionals can effectively identify and mitigate security risks in GWT applications.
