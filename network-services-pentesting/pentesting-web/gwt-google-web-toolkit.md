# GWT - Google Web Toolkit

## GWT RPC

GWT RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a mechanism provided by GWT to communicate between the client-side and server-side. It allows Java methods to be called from JavaScript and vice versa.

## GWT Security

When pentesting GWT applications, pay attention to the following security aspects:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** GWT applications are vulnerable to XSS attacks if proper input validation and output encoding are not implemented.
  
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** GWT applications can be vulnerable to CSRF attacks if anti-CSRF tokens are not used or validated correctly.

- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Improperly implemented GWT RPC methods can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to access unauthorized resources.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in GWT RPC calls or responses.

- **Client-Side Security:** Client-side code in GWT applications can be reverse-engineered, so avoid storing sensitive information or logic on the client side.

## GWT Testing Tools

There are several tools available for testing GWT applications:

- **GWT Developer Plugin:** A browser plugin that helps in debugging and testing GWT applications.

- **GWTTestCase:** A JUnit-based testing framework provided by GWT for unit testing GWT applications.

- **OWASP ZAP:** An intercepting proxy tool that can be used to test GWT applications for security vulnerabilities.

- **Burp Suite:** Another popular intercepting proxy tool that can be used for testing GWT applications.

By understanding the GWT architecture and common security pitfalls, you can effectively test and secure GWT applications against potential threats.
