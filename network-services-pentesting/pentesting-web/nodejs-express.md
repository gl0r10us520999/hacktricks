### batch mode-vaD multiple cookies lo'laH

To test multiple cookies using batch mode, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a file, for example `cookies.txt`, and add the cookies you want to test in the following format:
```
cookie1=value1
cookie2=value2
cookie3=value3
```

2. Use a tool like cURL or a scripting language to read the file and send requests with each cookie. For example, using cURL:
```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
  cookie=$(echo "$line" | awk -F'=' '{print $1}')
  value=$(echo "$line" | awk -F'=' '{print $2}')
  curl -b "$cookie=$value" http://example.com
done < cookies.txt
```

This will send a request to `http://example.com` with each cookie in the `cookies.txt` file.

3. Analyze the responses to see if any of the cookies are vulnerable to attacks or if they reveal sensitive information.

By testing multiple cookies in batch mode, you can efficiently assess the security of web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities.
```bash
cookie-monster -b -f cookies.json
```
### batch mode jatlh multiple cookies vItlhutlh custom wordlist

To test multiple cookies using batch mode with a custom wordlist, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a text file containing the cookies you want to test. Each cookie should be on a separate line.

2. Create a custom wordlist file containing the words you want to use for testing. Each word should be on a separate line.

3. Use a tool like `curl` or `wget` to send HTTP requests to the target web application. Include the cookies in the request headers.

4. Use a loop or a script to iterate through each cookie and each word in the wordlist. Combine them to create different combinations of cookies and words.

5. Send the HTTP requests with the different combinations of cookies and words to the target web application.

6. Analyze the responses from the web application to determine if any of the combinations result in successful authentication or other desired outcomes.

By testing multiple cookies with a custom wordlist, you can increase the chances of finding valid combinations and potentially identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the authentication mechanism of the web application.
```bash
cookie-monster -b -f cookies.json -w custom.lst
```
