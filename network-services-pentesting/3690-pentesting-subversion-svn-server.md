# Basic Information

**Subversion** is a centralized **version control system** that plays a crucial role in managing both the present and historical data of projects. Being an **open source** tool, it operates under the **Apache license**. This system is widely acknowledged for its capabilities in **software versioning and revision control**, ensuring that users can keep track of changes over time efficiently.

**Default port:** 3690
```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
3690/tcp open  svnserve Subversion
```
## Banner Grabbing

### tlhIngan Hol

### English

Banner Grabbing is a technique used to gather information about a target system by capturing the banner message sent by the server. This banner message often contains valuable information such as the server version, operating system, and other details that can be useful for further exploitation. Banner Grabbing can be performed using various tools and methods, including Telnet, Netcat, and specialized banner grabbing tools like Bannergrab and WhatWeb. It is an important step in the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test, as it helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system.
```
nc -vn 10.10.10.10 3690
```

### Service Detection

#### nIvbogh SVN Server

The first step in enumerating a Subversion (SVN) server is to identify its presence on the target network. This can be done using various methods, such as port scanning or banner grabbing.

##### Port Scanning

Port scanning involves scanning the target network for open ports to determine which services are running. The default port for SVN is 3690, so scanning for this port can help identify the presence of an SVN server.

##### Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing involves connecting to a specific port on the target server and capturing the banner or response message. This can provide information about the service running on that port. To perform banner grabbing for an SVN server, connect to port 3690 and capture the response.

### Version Detection

Once the presence of an SVN server is confirmed, the next step is to determine the version of the server software. This information can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities or exploits that can be used during the penetration testing process.

#### Using Nmap

Nmap is a popular network scanning tool that can be used to detect the version of an SVN server. By using the `-sV` flag along with the target IP address and port number (3690), Nmap can provide information about the SVN server version.

```
nmap -sV -p 3690 <target_ip>
```

#### Using Metasploit

Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing framework that includes various modules for scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities. The `svn_version` module can be used to detect the version of an SVN server.

```
use auxiliary/scanner/svn/svn_version
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
set RPORT 3690
run
```

### Repository Enumeration

Once the version of the SVN server is known, the next step is to enumerate the repositories hosted on the server. This can be done using various methods, such as SVN client commands or automated tools.

#### Using SVN Client Commands

SVN client commands can be used to interact with the SVN server and retrieve information about the repositories. The `svn list` command can be used to list the repositories hosted on the server.

```
svn list svn://<target_ip>:3690
```

#### Using Automated Tools

Automated tools, such as `SVNenum`, can also be used to enumerate the repositories on an SVN server. These tools automate the process of querying the server and retrieving information about the repositories.

```
svnenum.py -t <target_ip> -p 3690
```

### User Enumeration

Once the repositories are enumerated, the next step is to enumerate the users who have access to these repositories. This information can help in identifying potential targets for further exploitation.

#### Using SVN Client Commands

SVN client commands can be used to retrieve information about the users who have access to the repositories. The `svn log` command can be used to view the commit history, which often includes the usernames of the users who made the commits.

```
svn log svn://<target_ip>:3690/<repository_name>
```

#### Using Automated Tools

Automated tools, such as `SVNenum`, can also be used to enumerate the users on an SVN server. These tools automate the process of querying the server and retrieving information about the users.

```
svnenum.py -t <target_ip> -p 3690 -r <repository_name>
```

### Conclusion

Enumeration is an important phase in the penetration testing process, as it helps in gathering information about the target system. By identifying the presence of an SVN server, determining its version, enumerating the repositories, and enumerating the users, a penetration tester can gain valuable insights for further exploitation.
```bash
svn ls svn://10.10.10.203 #list
svn log svn://10.10.10.203 #Commit history
svn checkout svn://10.10.10.203 #Download the repository
svn up -r 2 #Go to revision 2 inside the checkout folder
```
