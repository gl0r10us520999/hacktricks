## **Basic Information**

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** serves as the internet's directory, allowing users to access websites through **easy-to-remember domain names** like google.com or facebook.com, instead of the numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. By translating domain names into IP addresses, the DNS ensures web browsers can quickly load internet resources, simplifying how we navigate the online world.

**Default port:** 53
```
PORT     STATE SERVICE  REASON
53/tcp   open  domain  Microsoft DNS 6.1.7601 (1DB15D39) (Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1)
5353/udp open  zeroconf udp-response
53/udp   open  domain  Microsoft DNS 6.1.7601 (1DB15D39) (Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1)
```
### Different DNS Servers

- **DNS Root Servers**: tlhIngan Hol: **DNS Root Servers**: Qa'Hom DNS hierarchy, managing the top-level domains and stepping in only if lower-level servers do not respond. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees their operation, with a global count of 13.

- **Authoritative Nameservers**: tlhIngan Hol: **Authoritative Nameservers**: Qa'Hom servers have the final say for queries in their designated zones, offering definitive answers. If they can't provide a response, the query is escalated to the root servers.

- **Non-authoritative Nameservers**: tlhIngan Hol: **Non-authoritative Nameservers**: Qa'Hom Lacking ownership over DNS zones, these servers gather domain information through queries to other servers.

- **Caching DNS Server**: tlhIngan Hol: **Caching DNS Server**: Qa'Hom type of server memorizes previous query answers for a set time to speed up response times for future requests, with the cache duration dictated by the authoritative server.

- **Forwarding Server**: tlhIngan Hol: **Forwarding Server**: Qa'Hom Serving a straightforward role, forwarding servers simply relay queries to another server.

- **Resolver**: tlhIngan Hol: **Resolver**: Qa'Hom Integrated within computers or routers, resolvers execute name resolution locally and are not considered authoritative.


## Enumeration

### **Banner Grabbing**

There aren't banners in DNS but you can gran the macgic query for `version.bind. CHAOS TXT` which will work on most BIND nameservers.\
You can perform this query using `dig`:
```bash
dig version.bind CHAOS TXT @DNS
```

```
### **Zone Transfer**

This procedure is abbreviated `Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone` (`AXFR`).

### **QIn**

QIn is a DNS query tool that can be used to perform zone transfers. It is a command-line tool that allows you to specify the target DNS server and the domain name for which you want to perform the zone transfer.

To perform a zone transfer using QIn, you can use the following command:

```
qin -s <dns_server> -d <domain_name>
```

Replace `<dns_server>` with the IP address or hostname of the target DNS server, and `<domain_name>` with the name of the domain for which you want to perform the zone transfer.

QIn will attempt to perform a zone transfer and display the results on the command line. If the zone transfer is successful, you will see a list of DNS records for the specified domain.

### **Dig**

Dig is another DNS query tool that can be used to perform zone transfers. It is a command-line tool that is available on most Unix-like operating systems.

To perform a zone transfer using Dig, you can use the following command:

```
dig axfr @<dns_server> <domain_name>
```

Replace `<dns_server>` with the IP address or hostname of the target DNS server, and `<domain_name>` with the name of the domain for which you want to perform the zone transfer.

Dig will attempt to perform a zone transfer and display the results on the command line. If the zone transfer is successful, you will see a list of DNS records for the specified domain.

### **Nmap**

Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that can also be used to perform zone transfers. It is available for multiple platforms and has a wide range of features.

To perform a zone transfer using Nmap, you can use the following command:

```
nmap -p 53 --script dns-zone-transfer --script-args dns-zone-transfer.domain=<domain_name> <dns_server>
```

Replace `<domain_name>` with the name of the domain for which you want to perform the zone transfer, and `<dns_server>` with the IP address or hostname of the target DNS server.

Nmap will attempt to perform a zone transfer and display the results on the command line. If the zone transfer is successful, you will see a list of DNS records for the specified domain.
```bash
dig axfr @<DNS_IP> #Try zone transfer without domain
dig axfr @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN> #Try zone transfer guessing the domain
fierce --domain <DOMAIN> --dns-servers <DNS_IP> #Will try toperform a zone transfer against every authoritative name server and if this doesn'twork, will launch a dictionary attack
```
#### DNS Enumeration

DNS enumeration is the process of gathering information about a target's DNS infrastructure. This information can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can be exploited during a penetration test.

##### DNS Zone Transfers

DNS zone transfers allow a secondary DNS server to request a complete copy of a zone's DNS records from a primary DNS server. This can be useful for an attacker as it provides a wealth of information about the target's DNS infrastructure, including hostnames, IP addresses, and other DNS records.

To perform a DNS zone transfer, you can use tools like `dig` or `nslookup`. Here is an example using `dig`:

```bash
dig axfr <domain> @<dns-server>
```

Replace `<domain>` with the target domain and `<dns-server>` with the IP address of the DNS server you want to perform the zone transfer against.

##### DNS Brute-Forcing

DNS brute-forcing involves systematically guessing subdomains of a target domain in order to discover hidden or forgotten subdomains. This can be done using tools like `dnsrecon`, `fierce`, or `sublist3r`.

Here is an example using `dnsrecon`:

```bash
dnsrecon -d <domain>
```

Replace `<domain>` with the target domain you want to brute-force.

##### DNS Cache Poisoning

DNS cache poisoning is an attack that involves injecting malicious DNS records into a DNS resolver's cache. This can lead to the redirection of traffic to malicious websites or the interception of sensitive information.

To perform DNS cache poisoning, you can use tools like `dnsspoof` or `mitmproxy`. These tools allow you to intercept DNS requests and inject your own DNS responses.

##### DNSSEC Zone Walking

DNSSEC zone walking is a technique used to enumerate DNS records in a zone that is protected by DNSSEC. It involves querying for non-existent subdomains and analyzing the responses to gather information about the existing subdomains.

To perform DNSSEC zone walking, you can use tools like `dnsenum` or `dnsrecon`. These tools automate the process of querying for non-existent subdomains and analyzing the responses.

##### DNS Enumeration Tools

There are several tools available for DNS enumeration, including:

- `dig`: A command-line tool for querying DNS servers.
- `nslookup`: A command-line tool for querying DNS servers.
- `dnsrecon`: A powerful DNS enumeration tool.
- `fierce`: A DNS reconnaissance tool.
- `sublist3r`: A subdomain enumeration tool.
- `dnsspoof`: A tool for DNS cache poisoning.
- `mitmproxy`: A tool for intercepting and modifying network traffic.

These tools can be used to gather information about a target's DNS infrastructure and identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
```bash
dig ANY @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>     #Any information
dig A @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>       #Regular DNS request
dig AAAA @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>    #IPv6 DNS request
dig TXT @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>     #Information
dig MX @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>      #Emails related
dig NS @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>      #DNS that resolves that name
dig -x 192.168.0.2 @<DNS_IP>   #Reverse lookup
dig -x 2a00:1450:400c:c06::93 @<DNS_IP> #reverse IPv6 lookup

#Use [-p PORT]  or  -6 (to use ivp6 address of dns)
```

- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source web application security scanner that can be used for automated vulnerability scanning and testing.

##### Conclusion

Automation plays a crucial role in network services pentesting, offering numerous benefits such as time-saving, consistency, scalability, accuracy, and repeatability. By leveraging automation tools, pentesters can streamline their workflows and enhance the effectiveness of their testing activities.
```bash
for sub in $(cat <WORDLIST>);do dig $sub.<DOMAIN> @<DNS_IP> | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done

dnsenum --dnsserver <DNS_IP> --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f <WORDLIST> <DOMAIN>
```
#### Using nslookup

#### nslookup-ghItlh

`nslookup` is a command-line tool used to query DNS (Domain Name System) servers to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and other DNS records. It is commonly used in network troubleshooting and DNS-related tasks during penetration testing.

`nslookup` is available on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. To use `nslookup`, open a terminal or command prompt and type `nslookup` followed by the domain name or IP address you want to query.

Here are some examples of how to use `nslookup`:

1. **Querying a Domain Name**

To obtain the IP address of a domain name, simply type the domain name after the `nslookup` command. For example:

```
nslookup example.com
```

This will return the IP address associated with the domain name `example.com`.

2. **Reverse DNS Lookup**

To perform a reverse DNS lookup, where you obtain the domain name associated with an IP address, type the IP address after the `nslookup` command. For example:

```
nslookup 192.168.1.1
```

This will return the domain name associated with the IP address `192.168.1.1`.

3. **Querying Specific DNS Servers**

By default, `nslookup` uses the DNS servers configured on your system. However, you can specify a different DNS server to query by typing the server's IP address after the `nslookup` command. For example:

```
nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
```

This will query the DNS server at IP address `8.8.8.8` for information about the domain name `example.com`.

4. **Changing Query Type**

By default, `nslookup` performs a standard query for the IP address associated with a domain name. However, you can change the query type to obtain different types of DNS records. To do this, type the query type followed by the domain name after the `nslookup` command. For example:

```
nslookup -type=mx example.com
```

This will return the mail exchange (MX) records for the domain name `example.com`.

5. **Interactive Mode**

`nslookup` also supports an interactive mode, where you can enter multiple queries without exiting the tool. To enter interactive mode, simply type `nslookup` without any arguments. Once in interactive mode, you can enter domain names or IP addresses to query, change the query type, and specify DNS servers.

```
nslookup
> example.com
> 192.168.1.1
> set type=mx
> example.com
> server 8.8.8.8
> example.com
> exit
```

This will perform a series of queries in interactive mode, including querying a domain name, an IP address, changing the query type, specifying a DNS server, and querying the domain name again.

`nslookup` is a versatile tool that can provide valuable information during network reconnaissance and penetration testing. By understanding how to use `nslookup`, you can gather information about DNS records, troubleshoot DNS-related issues, and identify potential vulnerabilities in DNS configurations.
```bash
nslookup
> SERVER <IP_DNS> #Select dns server
> 127.0.0.1 #Reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1, maybe...
> <IP_MACHINE> #Reverse lookup of a machine, maybe...
```
### Qapla' metasploit modules

#### DNS Enumeration

##### dns_brute

This module performs a brute force DNS enumeration by attempting to resolve all possible subdomains for a given domain.

### DNS - Reverse BF

#### Description

Reverse BF (Brute Force) is a technique used to discover subdomains by systematically guessing and querying DNS records. This technique involves iterating through a list of possible subdomains and sending DNS queries to check if they resolve to valid IP addresses.

#### Methodology

1. **Gather Information**: Collect as much information as possible about the target domain, such as the main domain name, known subdomains, and any other relevant details.

2. **Generate Subdomain List**: Create a list of potential subdomains based on common naming conventions, such as `www`, `mail`, `ftp`, `admin`, etc. Additionally, consider using tools like `dnsrecon`, `sublist3r`, or `amass` to generate an extensive list of subdomains.

3. **Perform Reverse BF**: Iterate through the subdomain list and send DNS queries for each subdomain. Check if the DNS query resolves to a valid IP address. Tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, or `host` can be used for this purpose.

4. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the DNS query results to identify any subdomains that resolve to valid IP addresses. These subdomains can be potential targets for further investigation or exploitation.

5. **Verify Subdomains**: Once potential subdomains are identified, verify their existence by accessing them through a web browser or using tools like `curl` or `wget`. This step helps confirm if the subdomains are active and accessible.

6. **Exploit**: If any subdomains are found to be active and accessible, further exploit them using appropriate techniques, such as subdomain takeover, vulnerability scanning, or other attack vectors.

#### Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of reverse BF attacks, consider implementing the following measures:

- Implement strong and complex subdomain naming conventions to make it harder for attackers to guess valid subdomains.
- Regularly monitor DNS records for any unauthorized changes or additions.
- Implement rate limiting or CAPTCHA mechanisms to prevent automated subdomain enumeration.
- Use DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses.
- Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block suspicious DNS queries.

#### Conclusion

Reverse BF is a powerful technique for discovering subdomains and can provide valuable information for further penetration testing or vulnerability assessment. By understanding this technique and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, organizations can better protect their DNS infrastructure from potential attacks.
```bash
dnsrecon -r 127.0.0.0/24 -n <IP_DNS>  #DNS reverse of all of the addresses
dnsrecon -r 127.0.1.0/24 -n <IP_DNS>  #DNS reverse of all of the addresses
dnsrecon -r <IP_DNS>/24 -n <IP_DNS>   #DNS reverse of all of the addresses
dnsrecon -d active.htb -a -n <IP_DNS> #Zone transfer
```

### Active Directory servers

#### Overview

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It provides a centralized location for managing and organizing network resources, such as users, computers, and groups. AD servers play a crucial role in the authentication and authorization process within a Windows domain.

#### Pentesting Active Directory Servers

When pentesting AD servers, there are several techniques and tools that can be used to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. Some of these techniques include:

- **Enumeration**: Enumerating AD servers can provide valuable information about the network, such as domain names, domain controllers, and trust relationships. Tools like `nmap` and `ldapsearch` can be used for this purpose.

- **Brute-forcing**: Brute-forcing AD servers involves attempting to guess usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access. Tools like `Hydra` and `Mimikatz` can be used for this purpose.

- **Exploiting misconfigurations**: AD servers can be vulnerable to misconfigurations that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges. Common misconfigurations include weak passwords, insecure group policies, and unpatched vulnerabilities.

- **Pass-the-Hash attacks**: Pass-the-Hash attacks involve using the hash of a user's password to authenticate as that user without knowing the actual password. Tools like `Mimikatz` can be used for this purpose.

- **Kerberoasting**: Kerberoasting is a technique that involves extracting service account credentials from AD servers. These credentials can then be cracked offline to gain unauthorized access. Tools like `Rubeus` can be used for this purpose.

- **Golden Ticket attacks**: Golden Ticket attacks involve forging Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to AD servers. Tools like `Mimikatz` can be used for this purpose.

#### Conclusion

Pentesting AD servers is an essential part of assessing the security of a Windows domain network. By identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, organizations can take proactive measures to secure their AD infrastructure and protect sensitive data.
```bash
dig -t _gc._tcp.lab.domain.com
dig -t _ldap._tcp.lab.domain.com
dig -t _kerberos._tcp.lab.domain.com
dig -t _kpasswd._tcp.lab.domain.com

nslookup -type=srv _kerberos._tcp.<CLIENT_DOMAIN>
nslookup -type=srv _kerberos._tcp.domain.com

nmap --script dns-srv-enum --script-args "dns-srv-enum.domain='domain.com'"
```
### DNSSec

DNSSec (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a set of security extensions for DNS that provide authentication and integrity for DNS responses. DNSSec uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity of DNS data, ensuring that the responses received are from legitimate sources and have not been tampered with.

DNSSec protects against various DNS attacks, such as DNS cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks. By validating the authenticity of DNS responses, DNSSec helps prevent attackers from redirecting users to malicious websites or intercepting their communications.

To implement DNSSec, a DNS zone must be signed with a private key, and the corresponding public key must be published in the DNS. When a client requests DNS information, the server signs the response with the private key, and the client can verify the signature using the public key. If the signature is valid, the client can trust the response.

While DNSSec provides enhanced security for DNS, it is not widely adopted. Many DNS servers and clients do not support DNSSec, and configuring DNSSec can be complex. Additionally, DNSSec does not protect against all types of DNS attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks.

Overall, DNSSec is a valuable security measure for DNS, but its implementation and adoption are still limited. It is important for organizations to assess the risks and benefits of implementing DNSSec in their DNS infrastructure.

```
## Bruteforce reverse DNS in using IPv6 addresses

To bruteforce reverse DNS in using IPv6 addresses, you can follow these steps:

1. Generate a list of possible IPv6 addresses that you want to bruteforce reverse DNS for. You can use tools like `ipv6gen` or `fcrackzip` to generate a list of possible addresses.

2. Use a DNS lookup tool like `nslookup` or `dig` to perform reverse DNS lookups for each IPv6 address in your list. For example, you can use the following command with `nslookup`:

   ```
   nslookup -type=PTR <IPv6_address>
   ```

   This will return the reverse DNS record for the specified IPv6 address.

3. Analyze the results of the reverse DNS lookups. Look for any patterns or interesting information that can help you in your pentesting activities. For example, you might find subdomains or hostnames that are associated with the IPv6 addresses.

4. Repeat the process for all the IPv6 addresses in your list.

By bruteforcing reverse DNS in using IPv6 addresses, you can gather valuable information about the target network and potentially discover vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that can be exploited during a pentest.

## Config files

### Introduction

Config files, short for configuration files, are files that contain settings and parameters for various applications and services. These files are commonly used in the context of network services, including DNS servers.

### Importance of Config Files in DNS Pentesting

During DNS pentesting, config files play a crucial role as they provide valuable information about the DNS server's configuration and settings. By analyzing these files, a pentester can identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can be exploited.

### Common Config Files in DNS Servers

#### 1. named.conf

The `named.conf` file is the main configuration file for the BIND DNS server. It contains global settings, zone configurations, and options for various DNS-related features. Pentesters can analyze this file to identify potential security weaknesses, such as misconfigured access controls or insecure zone transfers.

#### 2. named.conf.local

The `named.conf.local` file is used to define local zone configurations in the BIND DNS server. It includes settings for authoritative zones, forwarders, and other local DNS configurations. Pentesters can examine this file to identify potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities specific to the local DNS setup.

#### 3. named.conf.options

The `named.conf.options` file contains global options and settings for the BIND DNS server. It includes parameters related to logging, recursion, caching, and other DNS server functionalities. Pentesters can review this file to identify potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations that can be exploited.

### Conclusion

Config files are essential resources for DNS pentesters as they provide valuable insights into the DNS server's configuration and settings. By analyzing these files, pentesters can identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, allowing them to conduct effective penetration testing.
