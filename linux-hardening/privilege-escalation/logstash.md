## Logstash

Logstash is used to **gather, transform, and dispatch logs** through a system known as **pipelines**. These pipelines are made up of **input**, **filter**, and **output** stages. An interesting aspect arises when Logstash operates on a compromised machine.

### Pipeline Configuration

Pipelines are configured in the file **/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml**, which lists the locations of the pipeline configurations:
```yaml
# Define your pipelines here. Multiple pipelines can be defined.
# For details on multiple pipelines, refer to the documentation:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/multiple-pipelines.html

- pipeline.id: main
path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf"
- pipeline.id: example
path.config: "/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/1*.conf"
pipeline.workers: 6
```
**.conf** files, containing pipeline configurations, are located in this file. When using an **Elasticsearch output module**, it is common for **pipelines** to include **Elasticsearch credentials**, which often have extensive privileges because Logstash needs to write data to Elasticsearch. Wildcards in configuration paths allow Logstash to execute all matching pipelines in the specified directory.

### Privilege Escalation via Writable Pipelines

To attempt privilege escalation, first identify the user under which the Logstash service is running, typically the **logstash** user. Make sure you meet **one** of these criteria:

- Have **write access** to a pipeline **.conf** file **or**
- The **/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml** file uses a wildcard, and you can write to the target folder

In addition, **one** of these conditions must be met:

- Ability to restart the Logstash service **or**
- The **/etc/logstash/logstash.yml** file has **config.reload.automatic: true** set

If there is a wildcard in the configuration, creating a file that matches this wildcard allows for command execution. For example:
```bash
input {
exec {
command => "whoami"
interval => 120
}
}

output {
file {
path => "/tmp/output.log"
codec => rubydebug
}
}
```
DaH, **interval** vItlhutlh vItlhutlh frequency seconds. vaj **whoami** command, **/tmp/output.log** vItlhutlh output, 120 seconds vItlhutlh run.

**/etc/logstash/logstash.yml** vIlo' automatic **config.reload.automatic: true** vItlhutlh Logstash, pipeline configurations new modified automatically detect apply without restart. wildcard, modifications existing configurations vItlhutlh, caution advised disruptions avoid.
