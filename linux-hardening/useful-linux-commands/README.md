## Greps

### grep

The `grep` command is used to search for specific patterns within files. It can be used with regular expressions to perform complex searches. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Search for the word "password" in the file /etc/passwd
grep "password" /etc/passwd

# Search for the word "password" in all files within the current directory
grep "password" *

# Search for the word "password" in all files within the current directory and its subdirectories
grep -r "password" .

# Search for the word "password" in all files within the current directory, ignoring case
grep -i "password" *

# Search for the word "password" in all files within the current directory, displaying line numbers
grep -n "password" *
```

### egrep

The `egrep` command is similar to `grep`, but it supports extended regular expressions. This means that you can use more advanced patterns in your searches. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Search for either the word "password" or "passphrase" in the file /etc/passwd
egrep "password|passphrase" /etc/passwd

# Search for any word that starts with "pass" in all files within the current directory
egrep "pass\w+" *

# Search for any word that starts with "pass" or "key" in all files within the current directory, ignoring case
egrep -i "pass\w+|key\w+" *
```

### fgrep

The `fgrep` command is used to search for fixed strings, rather than patterns. This means that it will treat the search term as a literal string, rather than a regular expression. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Search for the exact string "password" in the file /etc/passwd
fgrep "password" /etc/passwd

# Search for the exact string "password" in all files within the current directory
fgrep "password" *

# Search for the exact string "password" in all files within the current directory and its subdirectories
fgrep -r "password" .

# Search for the exact string "password" in all files within the current directory, ignoring case
fgrep -i "password" *
```

### zgrep

The `zgrep` command is used to search for patterns within compressed files. It works in a similar way to `grep`, but it can handle files that have been compressed using gzip. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Search for the word "password" in the compressed file /var/log/syslog.gz
zgrep "password" /var/log/syslog.gz

# Search for the word "password" in all compressed files within the current directory
zgrep "password" *.gz

# Search for the word "password" in all compressed files within the current directory and its subdirectories
zgrep -r "password" .

# Search for the word "password" in all compressed files within the current directory, ignoring case
zgrep -i "password" *.gz
```

### Conclusion

The `grep` family of commands is a powerful tool for searching for specific patterns within files. Whether you need to search for a simple string or a complex regular expression, there is a command that can help you find what you're looking for.

## Qap

### Find Files

#### Find Files by Name

To find files by name, you can use the `find` command with the `-name` option. For example, to find all files with the name `password.txt` in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can run:

```
find / -name password.txt
```

#### Find Files by Type

To find files by type, you can use the `find` command with the `-type` option. For example, to find all directories in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can run:

```
find / -type d
```

To find all regular files (excluding directories and other special file types), you can run:

```
find / -type f
```

#### Find Files by Size

To find files by size, you can use the `find` command with the `-size` option. For example, to find all files larger than 1MB in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can run:

```
find / -size +1M
```

To find all files smaller than 1KB, you can run:

```
find / -size -1K
```

### Find Processes

To find processes running on your system, you can use the `ps` command. For example, to list all running processes, you can run:

```
ps aux
```

To filter the output and find a specific process, you can use the `grep` command. For example, to find all processes with the name `apache`, you can run:

```
ps aux | grep apache
```

### Find Network Connections

To find network connections on your system, you can use the `netstat` command. For example, to list all active network connections, you can run:

```
netstat -tuln
```

To filter the output and find a specific connection, you can use the `grep` command. For example, to find all connections on port `80`, you can run:

```
netstat -tuln | grep :80
```

### Find Users

To find users on your system, you can use the `cat` command to read the `/etc/passwd` file. For example, to list all users, you can run:

```
cat /etc/passwd
```

To filter the output and find a specific user, you can use the `grep` command. For example, to find all users with the username `admin`, you can run:

```
cat /etc/passwd | grep admin
```

### Find Installed Packages

To find installed packages on your system, you can use the package manager specific to your Linux distribution. Here are some examples:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `dpkg -l`
- **Red Hat/CentOS**: `rpm -qa`
- **Arch Linux**: `pacman -Q`

For example, to list all installed packages on a Debian/Ubuntu system, you can run:

```
dpkg -l
```

To filter the output and find a specific package, you can use the `grep` command. For example, to find the package `openssh-server`, you can run:

```
dpkg -l | grep openssh-server
```
```bash
# Find SUID set files.

## Nmap qaw'wI' jatlh

Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used by hackers and security professionals to discover open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on a target system. It provides a wide range of options and features to customize the scanning process.

Here are some useful Nmap commands and options to help you in your network scanning endeavors:

### Basic Scanning Techniques

- **TCP SYN Scan**: `nmap -sS <target>` - This scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target ports and analyzes the response to determine if the port is open, closed, or filtered.

- **TCP Connect Scan**: `nmap -sT <target>` - This scan establishes a full TCP connection with the target ports to determine if they are open or closed.

- **UDP Scan**: `nmap -sU <target>` - This scan sends UDP packets to the target ports and analyzes the response to determine if the port is open or closed.

### Advanced Scanning Techniques

- **OS Detection**: `nmap -O <target>` - This scan attempts to determine the operating system running on the target system by analyzing various network characteristics.

- **Service Version Detection**: `nmap -sV <target>` - This scan attempts to determine the version of services running on the target system by analyzing their responses.

- **Script Scanning**: `nmap -sC <target>` - This scan runs a set of predefined scripts to gather additional information about the target system.

### Output and Reporting

- **Output to File**: `nmap -oN <output_file> <target>` - This command saves the scan results to a specified file.

- **Output in XML Format**: `nmap -oX <output_file> <target>` - This command saves the scan results in XML format for further analysis.

- **Output in grepable Format**: `nmap -oG <output_file> <target>` - This command saves the scan results in a grepable format for easy parsing.

These are just a few examples of the many options and techniques available in Nmap. Experiment with different commands and explore the Nmap documentation to discover more ways to utilize this powerful tool in your network scanning activities.
```bash
#Nmap scripts ((default or version) and smb))
nmap --script-help "(default or version) and *smb*"
locate -r '\.nse$' | xargs grep categories | grep 'default\|version\|safe' | grep smb
nmap --script-help "(default or version) and smb)"
```

These are just a few examples of the many useful Bash commands available in Linux. By mastering these commands, you can become more efficient and productive in your Linux system administration tasks.
```bash
#All bytes inside a file (except 0x20 and 0x00)
for j in $((for i in {0..9}{0..9} {0..9}{a..f} {a..f}{0..9} {a..f}{a..f}; do echo $i; done ) | sort | grep -v "20\|00"); do echo -n -e "\x$j" >> bytes; done
```
## Iptables

### Description

Iptables is a powerful firewall utility for Linux systems. It allows you to configure and manage network filtering rules to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

### Basic Usage

To view the current iptables rules, use the following command:

```bash
iptables -L
```

To add a new rule to iptables, use the following command:

```bash
iptables -A <chain> <rule>
```

To delete a rule from iptables, use the following command:

```bash
iptables -D <chain> <rule>
```

### Chains

Iptables uses different chains to organize and process network traffic. The most commonly used chains are:

- **INPUT**: Controls incoming traffic to the system.
- **OUTPUT**: Controls outgoing traffic from the system.
- **FORWARD**: Controls traffic that is being routed through the system.

### Rules

Iptables rules define the criteria for matching network packets and the actions to be taken on those packets. Each rule consists of a set of conditions and an associated action.

Some commonly used rule options include:

- **-p**: Specifies the protocol (e.g., tcp, udp).
- **-s**: Specifies the source IP address or network.
- **-d**: Specifies the destination IP address or network.
- **-j**: Specifies the action to be taken (e.g., ACCEPT, DROP).

### Example

Here is an example of how to add a rule to iptables to allow incoming SSH connections from a specific IP address:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT
```

This rule allows incoming TCP traffic on port 22 (SSH) from the IP address 192.168.1.100.

### Conclusion

Iptables is a versatile tool for managing network traffic on Linux systems. By understanding its basic usage and rules, you can effectively control and secure your network connections.
```bash
#Delete curent rules and chains
iptables --flush
iptables --delete-chain

#allow loopback
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

#drop ICMP
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type any -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -j DROP

#allow established connections
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

#allow ssh, http, https, dns
iptables -A INPUT -s 10.10.10.10/24 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

#default policies
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```
